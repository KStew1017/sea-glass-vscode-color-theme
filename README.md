## Tips

- This theme was created initially with languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS in mind. Therefore if you are using a language or framework that is not properly supported, please open an issue on the [Sea Glass Theme Github Repo](https://github.com/KStew1017/sea-glass-vscode-color-theme) and I will try to add support for it.

- With colorized bracket pairs now a native feature in VSCode, I recommend disabling them in your settings for a cleaner look. To do this, open your `settings.json` file by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`. Then add the following line anywhere in your settings file:

```json
"editor.language.colorizedBracketPairs": [],
```
